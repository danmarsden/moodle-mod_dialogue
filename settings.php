 * Configure site-wide settings specific to the Dialogue modue

 * Note: the only setting currently relates to unread-post tracking - this will only be 
 * supported in your courses if you have applied the patch in CONTRIB-1134 which modifies
 * course/lib.php to check and display unread post counts in the course/topic area. 
 * If you havent applied that patch this setting will still be stored in Moodle but it
 * will have no effect on the display of your courses, ie users will not see an unread
 * posts count
